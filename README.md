# JS & Rockets

##### My resolution for the coding exercise called **'JS & Rockets'**.

The exercise consists in consuming SpaceX API and consolidate a list of all the missions that were launched in 2018 that carried a payload that belonged to NASA. Doesn't matter to which NASA program each payload belongs to as long as NASA is the customer (the customer value should contain the string 'NASA').

The missions should appear in inverse chronological order with the exception that missions that carried more payloads should appear first.

You have to display the outcome by rendering the list to the screen as JSON with an indentation of 2 spaces. You may show only the flight number (flight_number), mission name (mission_name) and the number of payloads carried by the mission (payloads_count).
